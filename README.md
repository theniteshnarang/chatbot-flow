# Chatbot Flow Builder (Vite + TS)

## Tech Stack
- React Flow
- MUI
- Typescript
- Zustand

## Getting up and running

```bash
yarn install
```

Vite is a great development server and build tool that we recommend our users to
use. You can start a development server with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

While the development server is running, changes you make to the code will be
automatically reflected in the browser!

## Things to try:

- Create a new custom node inside `src/nodes/` (don't forget to export it from `src/nodes/index.ts`).
- Change how things look by [overriding some of the built-in classes](https://reactflow.dev/learn/customization/theming#overriding-built-in-classes).
- Add a layouting library to [position your nodes automatically](https://reactflow.dev/learn/layouting/layouting)
